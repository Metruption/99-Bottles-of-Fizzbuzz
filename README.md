# 99-Bottles-of-Fizzbuzz
I've never actually used Git or GitHub and had a random stupid urge to code a crappy hashing algorithm based on the 99 bottles of beer on the wall song but decided that because this is the first time I'm doing something on github it's a good idea to include FizzBuzz to "prove myself".

The goal is to create a hashing algorithm based on both FizzBuzz and the 99 bottles of beer on the wall song. To fit the theme the algorithm will output a 99 bit hash and have 99 steps. For the purpose of a FizzBuzz step both a Fizz and a Buzz step will occur (the Fizz step will occur before the Buzz step in the event of a FizzBuzz step). There's probably a worse hashing algorithm out there. Until someone figures out how to reverse this or makes a rainbow table it'll still be more secure than md5.
